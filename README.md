# Project LIKE MINDED ROOMIES

### Short Explanation

This is a Project which helps people to find like minded Roomies. This helps persons who are looking for a Room or a person who is
looking for a RoomMate. 

### Problem Focussed On

In evry Room whether an Independent Room or a PG, there is always a person who is like an ODD ONE OUT. If he wants to move from the
place but he cant as he is alone and even the remaining people wants a new room mate with same kind of mentalities and Hobbies. So
that their time together after a Hectic work after office will be intresting. which inturn makes lifes easier.

### Use Case Senarios

1. I moved into a city alone which is totally irrelevant to me and start searching for rooms. I can walk on roads and search for
vacant Rooms and PG's. This problem is solved by apps like Nest Away, Magic Bricks and No Broker. But there is no guarantee that I
get the Roomies which I love. This App does the work for you, SomeHow shows the place where you fit in correctly. I could open the 
app start searching for vacant rooms and pg's which maps to my interest.

2. I have a Bunch of friends and want to share our room with other 1 or 2 persons so that Room expenses come down or what ever.
It will be awsome if my room is shared with a person who has similar set of mind set and who mingles with us correctly instead of
compromising with a person who does not fit in us even though he is a friend. This App gives the solution. I can post on the app
that I am looking for Room Mates with this intrests and hobbies.

3. I live in a PG and want to get a friend Who correctly fits with me. Who shares the Heart along with the Room. And MoreOver I
couldn't control who comes into my room in a PG. What if I could control that and could get a person who fits for me. This App
gives the solution. I can post on the app that I am looking for Room Mates with this intrests and hobbies.
